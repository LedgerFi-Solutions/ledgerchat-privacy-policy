    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 5, 2023</p>

    <p>LedgerChat Enterprise ("we", "us", "our", or "LedgerChat") operates the LedgerChat Enterprise mobile application
        (the "Service").</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, protect, and retain your information while using the LedgerChat
        Enterprise app, during both the pilot program and post-release. Your privacy and the security of your data are
        of utmost importance to us, and we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy protection.</p>

    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>We only collect information that is necessary for the proper functioning of the Service. The information we
        collect is used to provide and improve the Service, and it will not be used or shared in any other way except as
        described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>User Registration Information</h3>

    <p>To create an account, we collect your email address which is a unique identifier for each user. This information
        is required for user creation and is stored until the user account is deactivated. Upon deactivation, the
        account will be disabled, and the email address will be removed from our system.</p>

    <h3>Usage Data</h3>

    <p>During the pilot program, we may collect certain information automatically, including device unique ID to improve
        our services and provide a seamless user experience.</p>

    <h2>Data Encryption and Security</h2>

    <h3>Data Encryption</h3>

    <p>All data transmitted and stored within LedgerChat Enterprise remains encrypted both in transit and storage,
        utilizing industry-standard encryption protocols.</p>

    <h3>Zero Access</h3>

    <p>We have implemented strict access controls to ensure that your data remains confidential. We do not have access
        to the encrypted content of your messages or any user data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>

    <p>During the pilot program, all data will be retained for a maximum period of 90 days. After this period, all user
        details, including email addresses used for account creation, will be permanently deleted from our systems.
        Additionally, chat data will be rendered unusable, as the decryption keys held by users will also be removed.
        Consequently, the security and confidentiality of past conversations will be maintained.</p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

    <p>We do not share your information with third parties, except as required by law or when necessary to provide the
        services requested by you.</p>

    <h2>Links To Other Websites</h2>

    <p>Our Service does not contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. However, as a chat application,
        users can share links in the chat. We do not have any control over the content of these sites and are not
        responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>This application is not intended for children. The Service is meant for corporate or enterprise users and is not
        intended for personal use.</p>

    <h2>Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h2>

    <p>We will comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding data privacy and protection. You have the right
        to access, rectify, and delete your personal information. Please contact us if you wish to exercise these
        rights.</p>

    <h2>Updates to the Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be communicated to you
        through the app or via email.</p>

    <p>For any queries or concerns about our Privacy Policy or the protection of your data, please contact us at
        [contact information].</p>

    <p>By participating in the LedgerChat Enterprise pilot program, you acknowledge that you have read and understood
        this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection, use, and retention of your information as outlined herein.</p>
